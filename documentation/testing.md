  ## Error Resolution and Debugging 
1. Whilst not a problem that had occured from myself, it is worth noting that Gitpod had a authentication issue and meant I was unable to push saved work up to GitHub, this may result in some uncongruent and messy commit messages, see attached email for verification ![Gitpod auth error](../documentation/error_resolution_pics/Gitpod_authentication_error.png "Gitpod auth error picture")
2. It took me a couple of goes with the ascII art to realise that I have to break it down into three different print statements to show the images as I wanted them.
3. I have realised that the replay gives the same word. CHANGE LATER AFTER FIX
