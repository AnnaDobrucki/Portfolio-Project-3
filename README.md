# Hangman
Welcome to the well known universal game of Hangman! Where getting a letter wrong can mean pain of death...
Using python as my main platform I have built this game using both Gitpod and Heroku for my [Code Insitute Tertiary Project.](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/)
