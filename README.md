# Hangman
Welcome to the well known universal game of Hangman! Where getting a letter wrong can mean pain of death...
Using python as my main platform I have built this game using both Gitpod and Heroku for my [Code Insitute Tertiary Project.](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/)

## Project Goals
Overall Hangman is a well known game 


### User Goals
- Create an ease of use for the player.
- Have a tricky, but not hard time playing the game, and keep it varied.
- Create a username, linked to the scoreboard for added personalisation, potentially for the hope of returning use.
- Give them clear feedback whilst playing the game. 

## Features 
Key Features within this project:


## Design 
Whilst desgin for this project was less creative than past projects in terms of web desgin. I still wanted to give the project something to make it not look just like writing in a terminal. Ways in which I achieved this were:
1. Using ASCII Art from [fsymbols](https://fsymbols.com/text-art/) I got the looks of the Hangman intro/WIN/LOOSE fonts to stand out and look impactful. 

2. Creating the desgin for the loosing limbs hangman, to help the user visualise the Lives Lost, and keep track of hpw many tries they have left.

3. Using Colorama, after importing colours to help add definition for different lines of text. Helps to build tension for the user playing the game seeing colour progession. Found thanks to this helpful article [Colorama A Hidden Convenience](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/colorama-a-hidden-convinience-6fb22dc00835)



## Testing

## Credits 
Through-out building I predominantly used my knowledge gained from [Code Institue's Diploma Course](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/). As well as multiple other sources:

 I went through many different sites to help me with building this app:
 * I was struggling to understand how to do Error handling and this page helped me with learning how to print Error Messages [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_error_handling.asp)
 * Studying further into Booleans was helpful for itteraing through the current letters that had been guessed and checking againt the word itself. This article helped to break it down for me in a bitesized way [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-in-operator/)

 I was also inspired by these videos:


 After some sick leave I went back to revisit some basics and these challenges from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_ifelse1) were particularly helpful.
